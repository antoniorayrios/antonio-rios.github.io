My name is Antonio Rios, and I graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Bioengineering in 2023. Since June 2023, I am a research technician in the Regev Lab at Genentech, where I use technologies such as single cell RNA-seq to further biological discovery. While at Stanford, I optimized CRISPR tools for controlling many genes simultaneously in the Stanley Qi Lab. Additionally, I researched in the Engreitz Lab where I studied enhancer-promoter compatibility and genetic variation in the non-coding genome.

I hope to contribute to the expanding of machine learning and genomics using my previous research experience to guide me. Additionally, I am an avid reader and writer.
